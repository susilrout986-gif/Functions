    "Practical Questions:\n",
    "1)In Python, you can open a file for writing using the built-in open() function with mode \"w\" (write). Once the file is open, you can write a string to it using the write() method. Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "with open(\"example.txt\", \"w\") as file:\n",
    "    # Write a string to the file\n",
    "    file.write(\"Hello, world!\\n\")\n",
    "2)file_name = 'example.txt'\n",
    "\n",
    "with open(file_name, 'r') as file:\n",
    "    # Read and print each line\n",
    "    for line in file:\n",
    "        print(line, end='') \n",
    "3)When trying to open a file for reading, if the file does not exist, attempting to open it directly will raise an error.To handle this gracefully,  can use exception handling to catch the error and respond appropriately.\n",
    "filename = \"example.txt\"\n",
    "\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    with open(filename, \"r\") as file:\n",
    "        content = file.read()\n",
    "        print(content)\n",
    "except FileNotFoundError:\n",
    "    print(f\"Error: The file '{filename}' does not exist.\")\n",
    "4)input_file = 'input.txt'\n",
    "output_file = 'output.txt'\n",
    "\n",
    "try:\n",
    "        with open(input_file, 'r') as infile:\n",
    "        content = infile.read()      \n",
    "    with open(output_file, 'w') as outfile:\n",
    "        outfile.write(content)  \n",
    "5)n Python, you can catch and handle a division by zero error using a try-except block. The error raised for division by zero is called ZeroDivisionError. Here's a clear example:\n",
    "\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    numerator = 10\n",
    "    denominator = 0\n",
    "    result = numerator / denominator\n",
    "    print(\"Result:\", result)\n",
    "except ZeroDivisionError:\n",
    "    print(\"Error: Cannot divide by zero!\")\n",
    "\n",
